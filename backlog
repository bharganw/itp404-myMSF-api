Priority 1: 

Announcements
- Figure out why delete is not working instantly
- Add update announcements to modals
- Add any other attributes required for an announcement to the model/announcements.js file



Priority 2:
- Color alternate announcements
- Change the requirements of the announcement model (i.e. make the relevant fields required)

Dropdown
